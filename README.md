# Django-Storage-Supabase(WIP: DO NOT USE)


## About

This project aims to provide a custom storage backend for Supabase Storage so that it can be used as `/media` storage. This project heavily references the S3/Google Custom Storage backend in  [Django-Storages](https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages)


To do this we follow the [specification provided by Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/custom-file-storage/)

Eventually, we hope that this can be integrated into the django-storages library
and then write a blogpost/tutorial about it. We will write a description as well as tests shortly.




## Usage Instructions

1. `pip3 install django-storages-supabase	`

2. Fill up settings accordingly
