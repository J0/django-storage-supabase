# Django-storage-supabase(WIP: DO NOT USE)


## About

This project aims to provide a custom storage backend for Supabase Storage so that it can be used as `/media` storage. Eventually, we hope that this can be integrated into the django-storages library
and then write a blogpost/tutorial about it. We will write a description as well as tests shortly.

Will write a more elaborate description shortly. Thank you for your patience.
